# Proof of Concept: Running Jest with WebDriver

This repo presents minimal setup for running tests using Jest and WebDriver.
There are two example end-to-end specs written using Page Objects and Chain of
Invocation patterns.

    git clone git@github.com:alexeyraspopov/poc-jest-webdriver.git
    cd poc-jest-webdriver
    npm install
    npm run update
    npm test

It is recommended to use Node.js 8+ to run this example.
